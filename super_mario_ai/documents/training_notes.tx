The first episodes it sturggles to get past a big pipe withs simple movement

complex movement: My guy jumps around left and rightm still stuck on them pipes
After 10 episodes it learnt to mvoe forwards and not jump back too much is good
Runs into  ennemy all the time, same action just running straight for 400 episodes
Maybe its becuase the reward which is positive is too much depended on moving forwards? Over fitting?
Added also rewards based on ingame score to see if this fixes it
